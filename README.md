# names-in-periodic-table
## What is the project about
This project is meant to give you a list of all first names which can be put together using elements from the Periodic table.
The plan is to add option for user to create list of combinations out of various sets of names. I also want to add GUI and later start hosting the project meaning I want to transition from C# console app to a website.


## Manual for usage:
1. Download `Program.cs` and `Symbols.txt` files.
2. Make sure `Symbols.txt` file is in the  `Solution/bin/Debug/net6.0` folder.
3. Run the `Program.cs`.
